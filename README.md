# flutter_rust_bridge_template

This repository serves as a template for Flutter projects calling into native Rust
libraries via `flutter_rust_bridge`.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure that you have a working installation of the following items:
- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Rust language](https://rustup.rs/)
- `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` [cargo package](https://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/integrate/deps.html#build-time-dependencies)
- Appropriate [Rust targets](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/cross-compilation.html) for cross-compiling to your device
- For Android targets:
    - Install [cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk#installing)
    - Install [Android NDK 22](https://github.com/android/ndk/wiki/Unsupported-Downloads#r22b), then put its path in one of the `gradle.properties`, e.g.:

```
echo "ANDROID_NDK=.." >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
```

- For iOS targets:
  - Install [cargo-xcode](https://gitlab.com/kornelski/cargo-xcode#installation)
- [Web dependencies](http://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/template/setup_web.html) for the Web

Then go ahead and run `flutter run` (for web, run `dart run flutter_rust_bridge:serve` instead). When you're ready, refer to our documentation
[here](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_rust_bridge/index.html) to learn how to write and use binding code.

Once you have edited `api.rs` to incorporate your own Rust code, the bridge files `bridge_definitions.dart` and `bridge_generated.dart` are generated using the following command (note: append ` --wasm` to add web support):

### Windows
```
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --rust-input native\src\api.rs --dart-output .\lib\bridge_generated.dart --dart-decl-output .\lib\bridge_definitions.dart
```

### Linux/MacOS/any other Unix
```
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --rust-input native/src/api.rs --dart-output ./lib/bridge_generated.dart --dart-decl-output ./lib/bridge_definitions.dart
```

## Scaffolding in existing projects
